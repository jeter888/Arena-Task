# Arena-Task- UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS (5/13/20)
To open the Arena Task, clone or download/extract the zip file of this project and open *index_prelim.html* and start from there.

*Currently*: Any user that submits their "SONA ID" will have a text file which contains their input downloaded locally to their computer. Once the task is hooked up to a server, the text file will need to be saved to the experimenter's folder "SONA_data" found in the project files.
