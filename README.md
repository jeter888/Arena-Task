# Arena-Task- UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS (5/13/20)
To open the Arena Task, clone or download/extract the zip file of this project and open *index_prelim.html* and start from there.

*Currently*: Any user that submits their "SONA ID" will have a text file which contains their input downloaded locally on their computer. I am currently trying to make it so that the data saves on our end and not the participant's.

Update: Eliminated center preview box and created mouseover tooltip instead. Thinking of creating a toggle button option for participant if they want to turn on/off scene previews
