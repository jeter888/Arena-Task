# Arena-Task- UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS (5/26/20)
To open the Arena Task, clone or download/extract the zip file of this project and open *index_prelim.html* to begin the task.

*Currently*: Any user that submits their "SONA ID" will have a text file which contains their input downloaded locally to their computer. 
Likewise, with every trial submission during the task, a text file will be locally downloaded with each trial containing metadata (scene path and corresponding coordinates). 

Once the task is hooked up to a server, the text file will need to be saved to the experimenter's folder "SONA_data" found in the project files.

Currently, a new random set of scenes are generated from trial to trial. We will later have to implement the "Lift
 The Weakest" Algorithm in place of this. I have commented in the code where this should happen.
