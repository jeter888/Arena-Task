# Arena-Task- UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS
To open the Arena Task, clone or download/extract the zip file of this project and open *index_prelim.html* and start from there.

*Currently*: Any user that submits their "SONA ID" will have a text file downloaded locally on their computer with their input. I am currently trying to make it so that the data saves on our end and not the participant's.
